# Color

Foreground Color
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values
2. het codes
3. color names

Background Color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).

this is background code :
body {
background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}
h1 {
background-color: DarkCyan;}
h2 {
background-color: #ee3e80;}
p {
background-color: white;}

Understanding Color

Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them)

When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture

constract
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
we have three type :
1. low contract
2. high contract
3. medium contract
